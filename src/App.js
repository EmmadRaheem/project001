        One of the most familiar diagnostic methods is the use of venous blood as a test in a medical laboratory. 
        This needs an intrusive cannulation approach which requires proper vein selection. The use of a vein 
        finder will help the phlebotomist identify the vein quickly, avoid possible pre-analytical mistakes in 
        the specimen collection and reduce patients' anxiety and pain. Cannulation challenges doctors due to 
        the various factors that can be lessened by the use of a vein detector. In addition, changes in 
        methodology, patient numbers, demographic type of patients and equipment used in evaluating prototypes
         developed have been reported. Some studies in the actual human prototype test were limited. The 
         production of a low-cost infrared vein detector (IR) needs to be improved. commercialization. 
         Eventually, it was reported that there were minimal publications on phlebotomy efficiency 
         evaluations using vein detectors.
